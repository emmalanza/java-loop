# TimeTable Project

## Description

This project is a simple Java 23 application that generates the multiplication table for a given integer. 
The implementation follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach using JUnit 5 for testing and Jacoco for code coverage.

## Features

Generates a multiplication table from 1 to 10 for any given integer.

Uses JUnit 5 for testing.

Ensures a minimum of 70% code coverage using Jacoco.

Follows best practices with Maven as a build automation tool.

## Requirements
- Unit tests should be written for each method following TDD principles.
- Code coverage must be at least 70%.
- Commit messages should be clear and meaningful.
